# Data-visualizasion-with-python
Employing mathematical plotting library to create simple plots such as graphs and data plots.
Save the simple Graph practices in a separte directory in my project directory.
Create more interesting data sets based on random walks.
Create a package called pygal that focuses on creating visualizations that well on digital devices.
Emphasizing and resizing elements that users work with on the visualization.
Explore what happens when you roll a dice in various ways using pygal. 
Extracted specaific data from real world population and created visualizations 
The data is based on "Population_data.json" files, created visuals for the specific year 2010

# Road map for data visualization easy? Let's work with APIs
A program that generates visualizasion based on data we recieve
Used web API to automatically request specific information from a website
Generate visualizations with the requested data
We will do a visualizations on pyhton projects on github that use the pygal libraries

# Getting started with APIs
Install requests: on terminal "pip install --user requests"
